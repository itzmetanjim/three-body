    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>This is a 2D plot where each pixel corresponds to a particle. There are three (or more) circle-shaped attractors/planets that attract the particles. The color of each particle corresponds to the attractor it collides with.</p>
    <p>The particles do not attract the attractors or each other, but the attractors attract the particles. When chaos mode is enabled, the attractors also attract each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag to move attractors</li>
      <li>Press R to resimulate</li>
      <li>Press S to save a picture</li>
      <li>Right click to remove attractors</li>
      <li>Double click to add attractors</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Why are there ripples?</h1>
    <p>When increasing dT too much, you may see this kind of thing: </p>
    <img src="https://tanjim.org/three-body/ripples.png" alt="Ripples artifact example" style="max-width:600px;">
    <p>This happens because when dT is lowered, the particle moves more "discretely" and "jaggedly".</p>
    <p>This causes some particles in repeating distance increments to "miss" the attractor, causing ripples.</p>
    <img src="https://tanjim.org/three-body/why_ripples.png" alt="Ripples artifact diagram" style="max-width:600px;">
    <p>In this image you can see how the red particle goes to the attractor and gets colored while the black particle consistently overshoots it.</p>
    <h1>These streaks in chaos mode</h1>
    <img src="https://tanjim.org/three-body/chaos.png" alt="Ripples artifact diagram" style="max-width:600px;">
    <p>You can see streaks of same-colored hollow circles in chaos mode, which are generated when two attractors collide or one attractor<br>
       collides with the walls.</p>
    <img src="https://tanjim.org/three-body/streaks.png" alt="Ripples artifact diagram" style="max-width:600px;">
    <p>These happen because when attractors collide, they start moving very fast in a specified direction. This causes the particles that<br>
    were "winding around" the attractor to immetiadely collide, and these particles have their initial positions in different circle-shaped<br>
    regions. Each circle corresponds to a different path of winding around.</p>
    <h1> Other "artifacts"</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>There are many disjoint regions of the same color. Each of them correspond to a different path of winding around.</li>
      <li>When adding drag, some of the detail in the plot gets reduced. For example, drag 0.999 will look less random than drag 1.</li>
      <li>The points farthest from the attractors are the most random-looking, with small changes in coordinates causing changes in the color and region sizes becoming smaller.</li>
      <li>Increasing the radius of attractors also removes detail, because particles require less winding to reach the attractor.</li>
    </ul>
